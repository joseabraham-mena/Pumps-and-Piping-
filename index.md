# Pumps and Pipes Sizing Calculator

## Background and Purpose

  I spent the summer of 2017 interning at a local company and during that time Excel VBA was a very important part. 
 That same summer I also worked on a school project that required the design of piping systems, sizing of pumps 
 and design of heat exchanger. I decided to combine both to develop a spreadsheet that could do all the background calculations
 so that the designers could just change certain variables quick and easy. 
 
  The project developed into two different spreadsheets: a technical one and a more user-friendly one. The technical spreadsheet
 is intended as a visual aid to see how diameter and material impacts pressure drop across a pipe segment and total cost. The user-
 friendly speadhseet is intended to make the design process easier to execute and understand. 

  You can download both spreadsheets here and practice their user with the problems below:

 * [Technical spreadsheet](https://joseabraham-mena.github.io/Pumps-and-Piping-/Docs/Feed Section Scenario 1.xlsm) 
 

## Solved Problems

### Solved Problem 1:Finding ideal diameter given desired pressure drop and lenght

You have a pipe segment 20 meters long that runs through 2 90-degree, standard radius, fittings. 
The initial pressure at the beginning of the pipe segment is 150 kPa. 
You want the pipe segment to drop 50 kPa as it runs through the pipe. 

What is the ideal diameter?

Step 1) Set up the spreadsheet

Step 2) Set the desired pressure drop

Step 3) Solve for the ideal diameter

### Solved Problem 2: Finding pressure drop given diameter and lenghth
