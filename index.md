# Pumps and Pipes Sizing Calculator

## Background and Purpose

  I spent the summer of 2017 interning at a local company and during that time Excel VBA was a very important part. 
 That same summer I also worked on a school project that required the design of piping systems, sizing of pumps 
 and design of heat exchanger. I decided to combine both to develop a spreadsheet that could do all the background calculations
 so that the designers could just change certain variables quick and easy. 
 
  The project developed into two different spreadsheets: a technical one and a more user-friendly one. The technical spreadsheet
 is intended as a visual aid to see how diameter and material impacts pressure drop across a pipe segment and total cost. The user-
 friendly speadhseet is intended to make the design process easier to execute and understand. 
 
  You can download both spreadsheets here and practice their user with the problems below.
